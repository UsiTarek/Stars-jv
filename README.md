# Stars-jv
A very simple star system that moves towards the view.

A rite of passage before entering the world of software rendering, as I'm currently studying my way through the basics of rendering 3D graphics to a display.

# Why Java ? 

 - Offers a very easy and straightfoward interface to render a pixel on a screen.
 - Runs on virtually anywhere I might need to run this code in.
 - Easily readable by programmers coming from a multitutde of languages (C, C++, Javascript, Rust etc..)
 - No need to search for a third party library to quickly prototype stuff.
